# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description:

Using inquirer, I built a team profile app that allows the user to input an emplyee's name, email, and id, as well as school, github account, and office number contingent on their role within the company. 

To use the app, open your terminal and type npm i to install the relevant dependencies. Next, type node index.js to start being prompted with questions about your employees. Once finished, click on "quit" and an html page will be generated with your input data (please reference the walkthrough video below).
